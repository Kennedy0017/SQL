FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE Product = 'iPhone' 
AND length(orderID)=6
AND orderID <> 'Order_ID'

#3. Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.
SELECT customers.acctnum
FROM BIT_DB.customers
JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales
ON customers.order_id = FebSales.orderID
WHERE length(orderID)=6
AND orderID <> 'Order_ID'

#4. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price?
SELECT min(price),product
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY product, price
ORDER BY price ASC 
LIMIT 1 

#5. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?
SELECT sum(quantity) * price as revenue, product
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY product

WHERE location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
GROUP BY product

#7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time, and what was the average amount spent for those customers? 
select 
SELECT Count(cust.acctnum), avg(quantity * price)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales Feb

ON Feb.orderID = cust.order_id
WHERE Feb.quantity > 2
AND length(orderID)=6
