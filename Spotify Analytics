-- For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle.
-- Then I created a table to insert Spotify data into.
-- Finally, I performed analytics on the data using SQL. 

CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
song_key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
song_mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness decimal(8,7) NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL )

-- Then I inserted the Spotify Data .csv into the table.

-- Next, I explored the data using the following SQL. 

-- Selecting all data from the Spotifydata table
SELECT *
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata

-- I determined the amount of songs each artist had on the Spotify list
SELECT artist_name, count(id) as songs
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name
ORDER BY count(id) DESC

-- Then I determined who the Top 10 artists are by popularity
SELECT track_name, artist_name, popularity
FROM BIT_DB.spotifydata
ORDER BY popularity desc
LIMIT 10

-- I determined the avg duration of songs that had a popularity greater than 90
SELECT avg(duration_ms)
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
WHERE popularity > '90'

-- Finally, I determined the song name and tempo of the tracks by Doja Cat with a popularity greater than 90
SELECT tempo, track_name
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
WHERE artist_name like 'Doja_Cat'
AND popularity > '90'
GROUP BY track_name
ORDER BY tempo DESC
